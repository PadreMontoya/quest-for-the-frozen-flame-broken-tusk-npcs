  "description": "This module contains a full set of NPC tokens for the Broken Tusk clan, art for many of the monsters, as well as art for handouts.  For consistency, all characters have been reimagined using Midjourney.  Gaps in the tribe roster have been filled in and inspired by u/PeterArtdrews from the Reddit post at https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder2e/comments/108g16m/quest_for_the_frozen_flame_our_broken_tusk/.  I'll likely update this pack as our group players through the campaign.",
